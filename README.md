# Computer Vision Projects

Welcome to my Computer Vision Projects repository! Here you'll find implementations of various computer vision applications that I learned from [Murtaza's Workshop](https://www.youtube.com/@murtazasworkshop) YouTube channel.

## About

I have learned computer vision techniques such as face detection, hand detection, hand gestures recognition, and color-based object detection from Murtaza's Workshop YouTube channel. In this repository, I have implemented several projects based on these techniques:

### Cursor

The Cursor project allows for controlling the mouse cursor using finger movements captured by a camera. This application enhances user interaction by providing a hands-free method for cursor manipulation.

### TapGame

TapGame is a simple game that utilizes a camera to detect hand movements. Players must tap on objects displayed on the screen using their hands, adding an interactive element to the gaming experience.

### Face Detection

The Face Detection project detects faces in images or video streams captured by a camera. This application can be used for various purposes, such as security surveillance, biometric identification, or augmented reality.

Additionally, you can find other smaller projects in the "Basics" and "Hand Detection" folders, which cover fundamental computer vision concepts and hand detection techniques.

### VolumeUp

VolumeUp is a project that enables volume control using finger gestures detected by a camera. This application provides a convenient way to adjust the volume of a device without the need for physical buttons.
